3D-Projection
=============
Interested in drawing 3D shapes to the screen a while back I decided to test out some false 3D Projection. I decided to use a basic cube because it was a simple shape. When the program is run you have the option to rotate the cube around the X, Y, or Z axis to any angle. This ended up being a cool representation of 3D Projecion so I left it as is and never did anything more with the project.
